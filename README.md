# AranBTUSB
Simple serial monitor Android App to communicate with Arduino via USB or Bluetooth (ch-05, ch-06).

<h2>Soon</h2>

I will soon try to upload just the library that manages the connections and makes it very simple to include in your app.

The serial_bt_usb library is the one that make the connection (either via bluetooth or usb) you can check out the 
SerialActivity class to see how to interact with the device

<h3>Im just starting with Android Development, so use this at your own risk!</h3>
