# AranBTUSB
Simple serial monitor Android App to communicate with Arduino via USB or Bluetooth (ch-05, ch-06).

<h2>Soon</h2>

I will soon try to upload just the library that manages the connections and makes it very simple to include in another app.

The serial_bt_usb library is the one that make the connection (either via bluetooth or usb) you can check out the 
SerialActivity class to see an example how to interact with the device.

This project (the serial_bt_usb library) uses the https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial/ library for the USB serial communications and it is based on this guide: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/communicate-with-your-arduino-through-android/

<h3>Im just starting with Android Development, so use this at your own risk!</h3>
